# nolibc

Nolibc is a libc-less wrapper to make tiny static executables for simple programs

The project was integrated into the Linux kernel where it now moves much faster.
The code is located under ` tools/include/nolibc` in the kernel.

This repository continues to be occasionally resynchronized with the kernel for
those who need the ease of use of an out-of-tree project, though do not expect
frequent updates.

The latest resync was made against Linux 6.16-rc1.
